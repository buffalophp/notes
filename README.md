# Meeting notes from past BuffaloPHP meetups

## How to add your presentation

### Option 1: Fork it

The first, and prefered option, is to fork this repo and add your code in the following structure:

```
/ <-- repo root
    <event date in YYYYMMDD format, e.g., 20130611>/
        <screenname/email/etc, e.g., shawncplus>/
            <your files here>
        README.md
```

Example structure

```
/
    20130611/
        shawncplus/
           stuff/
           blah.php
        README.md
```

After that, send a pull request describing your talk. You can also tweet @buffalophp

### Option 2: Host it yourself

Within option #2 there are two further options: A) Fork and edit the README.md for the event date, B) Tweet @buffalophp
